  <h2>The History of Tucker's</h2>
  <p>Marshall Tucker and his wife Verda left their Chico California home in the spring of 1941, planning to establish an ice cream business in the city of Santa Cruz. Mr. Tucker had learned the trade from his aunt and uncle in an ice cream store that is still going to this day. Taking a break on the journey South, they stopped for lunch and ventured into the city of Alameda. What they found here was a unique and warm community that would make an ideal home to raise their children and build a business.

With the decision to remain in Alameda, Marshall Tucker celebrated the grand opening on June 3rd, 1941 with his family recipes for super creamed ice cream. On the opening day, some 381 customers were served with total receipts of $40.40. Through the years, Tucker’s Ice Cream grew to be a central meeting place and supporter of community programs. sports activities and youth.

Kate Pryor, a second generation Alamedan,  grew up enjoying Tucker’s Ice Cream and had the opportunity to purchase the business in 1990. Still using  the original recipes and adding some new twists, Kate has carried on the traditions of both producing the finest Supercreamed Ice Cream around and investing in her community through service and support.

In April of 2000, Kate moved the business to its current and larger location, which offers comfortable seating for families and groups including a lovely open-air patio for puppies and children of all ages. One thing that hasn’t changed: Tucker’s still makes Alameda’s finest ice cream and in its beautiful location one can enjoy some stolen moments reminiscent of a time gone by!</p>
